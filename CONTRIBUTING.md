# Contributing Guide  

Thank you for considering contributing to the **Web Navigator AI Agent**!  

## Steps to Contribute  

1. **Fork** the repository  
2. **Clone** your fork  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-navigator-ai-agent.git


git checkout -b feature-branch


git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"
git push origin feature-branch



---

That way, **README.md = Project Overview** and **CONTRIBUTING.md = How we worked + how others can help**.  

Do you want me to **write the actual README.md file content** (ready to paste into GitHub) for your project, with placeholders filled?
